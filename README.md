# RoDroid

**RoDroid** is a branded, browser-based emulator that lets you run x86-based operating system ISOs and disk images directly in your web browser. Itâ€™s powered by [`v86`](https://github.com/copy/v86) and supports lightweight Linux, FreeDOS, and other OSes you can boot from ISO/IMG/VHD files.

## Features

- Upload and boot your own ISO/IMG/VHD files in the browser
- Modern UI, smooth animations, and custom branding
- No install or plugins required
- Works on any modern browser

## Usage

1. **Clone or deploy this repo** (works great with GitHub Pages!)
2. Open `index.html` in your browser, or visit your GitHub Pages site.
3. Click "Choose file" and select a bootable ISO/IMG/VHD.
4. Click "Run ISO/IMG" and watch it boot!
5. Use "Stop" to reset/stop the emulator.

## Notes

- **Performance:** Best with small OSes like FreeDOS, TinyCore Linux, KolibriOS, etc. Large or modern OSes will be slow or may not work.
- **Security:** All emulation runs in the browser, nothing is uploaded to a server.
